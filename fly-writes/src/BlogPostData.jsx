I still remember all my favorite radio stations that introduced me to Hip Hop and R&B growing up. I still remember listening to Rihanna and Drake for the first time on the radio!",

          "Before I started working on Fly Radio, I remember talking to one of my friends last year about how to craft projects for my portfolio, and they suggested I find ways to incorporate my interests and my personality into my work. I thought long and hard about what makes me me, what makes me happy etc. and music was the first thing that came to mind. Music has been my most consistent interest over the years so I thought about what I could create with that.",

          "Then I remembered seeing a fan made project of J Dilla’s Donuts album where they showcased the songs beautifully — it looked almost like a radio station. Then I thought, “Wait, I could actually build my OWN radio station!”. And that’s how Fly Radio was born. It felt like the perfect opportunity to turn my love for music into something real, something I could share with the world while developing my skills and doing what I love.",

        content:
          "A big part of who I am comes from the music I listened to growing up and present day. I still remember wanting to be part of YMCMB when I was younger (LOL). I wanted to rap, sing and dance! As I got older, I wanted to be a music producer and have my own record label. But life didn’t happen that way, but my love for music never changed and I love how I found a new opportunity to work with music. I never imagined music curation as something I would end up doing, but I decided to still pursue this new path and see where it takes me.",

          "My taste in general, not just in music, is one of my favorite things about myself. I always joke about how building a career in tastemaking would be my ultimate dream. I believe I have a strong ability to highlight great music and Fly Radio is creating a path where I can take the chance to make this dream a reality and proudly showcase this ability.",
